#Inter Rater Reliability Calculator for
Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM 

This Program is meant to calculate the IRR of student researchers who will be observing instructors with the use of COPUS. 

The program will use Krippendorff's alpha (α).

Krippendorff's alpha (α) is a reliability coefficient developed to measure the agreement among observers, coders, judges, raters, or measuring instruments drawing distinctions among typically unstructured phenomena or assign computable values to them.

More information about Krippendorff's alpha can be found here.
